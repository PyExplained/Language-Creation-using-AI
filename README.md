# Language-Creation-using-AI

Is it possible to artificially create a novel language using AI? That is the question that started this project. I thought it would be an interesting experiment to see if I could make an AI do just that and the results were surpringly good. If you want to know more about this project (how the model works, etc.), you can watch this video: *Link will appear shortly*.

You can find the dataset here: https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads.

Also, If you have any idea how I could improve the AI, let me know.
